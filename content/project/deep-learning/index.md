title: Forward Simulation modeling 

summary: As a geneticist, Sharifu is involved in simulation modeling the process of creating and analyzing a digital prototype of a population genetics model to predict how different alleles change in the real world. Here the code from his first forward simulation model, working with a selfing population of monkeyflowers.
